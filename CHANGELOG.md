## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Auto-release now publishes to npm. A release created by `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger other workflows, so `publish.yml` never fired; `auto-release.yml` now dispatches it explicitly via `workflow_dispatch`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Test suite (`node:test`) and a CI workflow running on push/PR across Node 18/20/22.
- Auto-release workflow: a version bump merged to `main` creates the matching tag + GitHub Release, which triggers publishing.
- npm provenance on publish, with a test gate before `npm publish`.
- `uninstall` subcommand to remove the kit's guides and commands.
- `--project` install mode: vendors guides + commands into a repo's `./.claude/` (repo-relative paths) so a cloned repo gets working commands with no global install.
- `.gitignore` and this changelog.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- `/setup-claude` restructured into five phases so all user decisions are batched up front; only Graphify's `CLAUDE.md` append runs last, preserving the "kit's CLAUDE.md first" ordering.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Self-contained `SUMMARY.html` synthesis and investigation findings as HTML.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- Graphify offer no longer short-circuits when the CLI is already on `PATH`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Preflight checks, `/quick` command, Graphify integration, graph-freshness check, and `.claude/` coverage detection.
